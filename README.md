# vagrant-ansible-hadoop-single-node
Builds a machine based on the Hadoop single node setup guide for 2.7.1.  Follows the [guide]() up until formatting the hdfs system.
From there on out it's easy enough to take the next steps by hand to see how it works.  I may add the additional steps in the future,
but that will likely come after building a multi-node cluster version.

# Usage
```vagrant up```
